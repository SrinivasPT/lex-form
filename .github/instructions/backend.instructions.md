# Backend (Node.js) Conventions

-   Use Node.js with Express for the server (see `server.js`).
-   Manage dependencies in `package.json`; use npm scripts for start/dev.
-   Keep server logic modular; use services for business logic.
-   Follow RESTful API patterns for endpoints.
-   Ensure proper error handling and logging.
